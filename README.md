### This is my Web-101 project. <br/>
I was given the website [modesense.com](https://modesense.com/) to create.

I have used all my learning like
- Use of localstorage to store and use data.
- Use of DOM
- higher order functions
- [Bootstrap Modal](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/modal/)
- JQuery for Sliding UP/Down Effect and loading Header on page load
- Multi-Image slider with left to right effect.
- Media Query for making website responsive -->
